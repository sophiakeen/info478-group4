#Purpose
Mental health is a large and global problem that impacts people of all demographics. With this research project, we're aiming to better understand the correlation between mental health, healthcare, and socioeconomic status. How do these differences impact mental health and suicide rates. 

#Related Research
https://ourworldindata.org/suicide 
This website provides information on suicide to hopefully promote discussion and prevention. By looking at data from WHO, suicide is one of the leading causes of death in young people, taking about 800,000 people globally per year.

This article studies the association between mental healthcare and reduced suicide rates. This is focused on examining mental health parity laws and improved access to care on the impact of suicide rates

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajim.23118 
This article assesses the role of socioeconomic status as an effect modifier, while examining whether the socioeconomic status level affects the relationship between work-life conflict and mental health. (The article claims that there is little empirical evidence for a  difference in the impact of work-life conflict by socioeconomic status.)

#Datasets
https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/mental-health-and-suicide-rates?select=Age-standardized+suicide+rates.csv
Mental Health and Suicide Rates Kaggle dataset show suicide rates of age groups in different countries along with health facility. It has information about age-standardized suicide rates, crude suicide rates, amount of mental health facilities and human mental aide resources per country per 100,000 population.

https://healthdata.gov/State/Adult-Depression-LGHC-Indicator-/73c2-5f46
The Adult Depression (LGHC Indicator) dataset displays the proportion of adults who were ever told they had a depressive disorder in California. We accessed it from a .gov website, indicating it is a government website, so the dataset is more reliable.

#Target Audience
While we try to inform UW students on the impact of mental health and how it correlates with socioeconomic status, our target audience could be anyone interested in knowing more about mental health and how it might affect their lives.

#What we're trying to answer
How does access to mental health care affect suicide rates? 
What is the correlation between socioeconomic status and mental health?
What is the correlation between race and mental health?

#Technical Description
The format of your final product is a Shiny app, but we are open to learning other formats. If that is the case, we will need to learn how to implement that. Overall, we are relearning our R technically skills and we want to learn more CSS to make our final product more presentable. 

We do anticipate data collection and data management challenges. For one of our datasets, we need to filter out countries that have no data (have N/A in their values). We most likely need to do R functions like pivot_wider to improve our dataset tables. Overall the major challenge we anticipate is cleaning up our data, merging data sets together that will accurately and more easily make a visualization. Another major challenge is we will need to relearn our R skills on how to make visualizations.
